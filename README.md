# ULTRASUONO
turn climate into sound

By Angelo Valerio Angiola, Federico Bottari, Nicol√≤ Buselli, Tito Poles

Ultrasuono is an environmental recorder capable of perceiving the climate around it and transforming it into a series of sound effects that directly influence the recorded audio.
The environmental parameters taken into account are light, humidity, and temperature. The result is an exploratory tool capable of generating unique sounds, designed for artists, live performers, sound designers, and field recorders.

Ultrasuono is an open-source project, all the documentation to make it is available for free, using standard electronic modules, basic components, and a 3D printer.

Originally developed as part of the Design for Components module within the Master's Degree Program in Systemic Design, the project now continues as a thesis. Its development
will focus on enhancing the current device to make it more flexible, professional and suitable for musical and experiential contexts.
